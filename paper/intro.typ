= Introduction

Robotic systems that interact with physical game environments provide a compact yet challenging testbed for perception, decision-making, and actuation. In this work, we present a modular robotic system capable of playing the board game Nine Men’s Morris using a robotic arm. The project combines computer vision for board state detection, artificial intelligence for strategic gameplay, and precise robotic manipulation to execute moves on a physical board. The game was chosen due to its relatively simple ruleset, discrete state space, and strong dependence on long-term strategy, making it well suited for evaluating the interaction between symbolic game logic and real-world execution.

To manage system complexity and enable parallel development, the project was split into three largely independent components. The robotic arm control was developed by Eugen and Karla, focusing on reliable grasping and placement of pieces. Board state detection was implemented by Marie and Kitti, who were responsible for perceiving the current game state from sensor input. The AI component, including game logic and training of a strategy to play Nine Men’s Morris, was developed by Frederik. To ensure seamless integration, all components were implemented as Python modules exposing a single class with one primary function that performs the respective task. This design allowed each subsystem to be developed, tested, and refined independently while maintaining a consistent integration interface.

A common high-level API was defined based on an abstract representation of the game state and actions. All components operate on a shared board representation consisting of an array of 24 elements, corresponding to the 24 valid positions on a Nine Men’s Morris board. Each index represents a fixed board position, numbered sequentially starting from the top-left position and continuing in a consistent order. This unified abstraction decouples perception, decision-making, and actuation, enabling the AI to reason purely symbolically while the perception and robotic subsystems translate between physical reality and the abstract game model. The resulting architecture demonstrates how clear abstractions and modular interfaces can simplify the development of integrated robotic game-playing systems.
